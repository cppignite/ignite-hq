  Start off with question, if you had the chance to give your high school
  self advice, what would it be?

+ What is igniteCS?
  igniteCS is a Google partnered educational outreach organization which
  started as a program to provide computer science to kids that do not have 
  access to it with the main purpose of increasing multicultural diversity
  to the field.

  + Now we have developed into a much more expansive organization with multiple
  approaches to the problem of CS education, or lack thereof.

+ What we do
  When ignite first started, what we did is that we taught android development 
  through scratch to the middle and high school level but that's it.

  + What we discovered
  2 problems.
  1.) Lack of CS teachers
  2.) Shitty CS teachers
  Computer science does not require math. Computer Science can be taught young.
  Kids like building stuff and they want to get involved because they grew up
  with computers.
